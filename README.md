# Random-Word-Guessing-Game

The program is a simple word guessing game that allows the user to guess a 5-letter word randomly selected from a predefined list. The game starts by welcoming the user and asking for their name, after which it explains the rules of the game and the number of turns the user has to guess the word. On each turn, the program displays the current state of the word, with unguessed letters represented by "_", and the number of turns remaining. The user is prompted to make a guess, and the program checks if the guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the program updates the state of the word to show the correct letters. If the guess is incorrect, the number of turns remaining is decremented by 1. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of turns. At the end of the game, the program displays a message indicating whether the user won or lost and reveals the word.

The code is written in Python and uses the random module to choose the word from the list. The game loop is implemented using a while loop that continues until the word is correctly guessed or the user runs out of turns. The program checks the user's input to make sure it is a single character and updates the state of the word using a for loop that iterates through the letters of the word. The program also provides some basic error handling, such as checking that the user's input is a single character, to ensure a better user experience. Overall, the program provides a simple and fun word guessing game that can be easily modified to add more words or change the number of turns.
